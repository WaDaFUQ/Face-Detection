# Face-Detection
About Haar_cascade:
- Pros: Easy to use.
- Cons: Wrose performance & accuracy than CNN

[Ver1.0]
 - Prototype of the face detection system applied on the course roll-call.
 - Simple register feature now: create_data.py 
 - Detection algo: haar_cascade provided by OpenCV. 
 - Known bugs: create_data.py & detector can't terminate properly currently.

[What will be develop in the future]
 - Apply the register feature on MySQL to improve stability & functionality of database.
 - port the system to a better classification algo: CNN (Convolution Neural Network), it may be "Face_net module".
 - Finally train the model through Tensorflow.
